	beq 1 2 done	when register 1 and register 2 are same, we have to go halt instruction. but the branch outcome determined at ALU stage. So we have to wait until branch outcome determined before fetching next instruction. So we can include two noop instruction in front of add instruction. Or if we use speculation method, we have to stall the mispredict instruction and fetch the right instruction

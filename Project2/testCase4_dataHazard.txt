	lw 0 1 ten	register 1 is updated at WB stage
	noop
	add 1 2 3	add instruction reads register value at ID stage so add cannot read the updated value of register 1. (Data Hazard)
	noop		so we can solve this problem by including two more noop instructions in front of add instruction
	noop
	noop
	beq 1 3 done
	noop
	noop
	noop
done	halt
ten	.fill 10
neg1	.fill -1
A0	.fill 0
A1	.fill 1
